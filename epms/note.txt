Because Manager must finally submit the completed assessment back to Employee for acceptance.

Sends reviewed form to Employee.

Updates status from:
MANAGER_REVIEWED → SENT_TO_EMPLOYEE

Employee will then accept and final submit to HR.

“After the employee accepts the ratings, they should click on ‘Final Submit’, which will then forward the form to HR for further action.”

(PMS_REQUIREMENT_Jan 26)

===============================================================================================================================

GET		:	http://localhost:9010/api/goals/employee/pending-acceptance/EMP101/Q1

✅ Why we created this API?

Because after Manager (R1) reviews the employee goals and submits back, the employee must be able to view the reviewed goals before accepting.

Employee should see:

Manager Rating

Manager Remarks

Reviewed goals list

Updated goal status

So this API is required to fetch goals which are waiting for employee acceptance.

✅ How it helps?

This API helps the UI to show the "Pending Acceptance" section in employee screen.

It ensures employee sees the manager’s assessment before final submission.

✅ Requirement mentioned in PPT?

✅ Yes

📌 PPT Requirement (Copy)

"Once Manager / R1 completes this assessment, it is submitted to the employee for acceptance."

This clearly means employee must have a screen to view reviewed goals, so GET API is needed.

===============================================================================================================================

PUT		:	http://localhost:9010/api/goals/employee/accept/EMP101/Q1

✅ Why we created this API?

Because employee must explicitly accept manager’s review (rating + remarks) before final submission to HR.

Without acceptance, employee cannot forward the form.

This API confirms employee has agreed with manager evaluation.

✅ How it helps?

Locks employee’s acceptance

Updates goal status from:

SENT_TO_EMPLOYEE → ACCEPTED_BY_EMPLOYEE

Prepares system for final HR submission step

✅ Requirement mentioned in PPT?

✅ Yes

📌 PPT Requirement (Copy)

"After the employee accepts the ratings, they should click on ‘Final Submit’, which will then forward the form to HR for further action."

This statement directly requires an Accept action, so PUT API is mandatory.

===============================================================================================================================

PUT		:	http://localhost:9010/api/goals/final-submit/EMP101/Q1

Because after employee accepts manager rating, employee must final submit the complete goal form to HR.

This API will:

Validate employee already accepted goals

Change status from:

ACCEPTED_BY_EMPLOYEE → FINAL_SUBMITTED_TO_HR

Lock the process for HR action

✅ PPT Requirement Mapping (Important for Interview)

📌 PPT Line:
"After the employee accepts the ratings, they should click on ‘Final Submit’, which will then forward the form to HR for further action."

This sentence directly demands this API.


✅ Status Flow After This
Step	Status
Manager sends to employee	SENT_TO_EMPLOYEE
Employee accepts	ACCEPTED_BY_EMPLOYEE
Employee final submit	FINAL_SUBMITTED_TO_HR

===============================================================================================================================

GET		:	 http://localhost:9010/api/annual-review/goals/EMP101/2026

✅ Why we need this API?

Because during Annual Performance Review, employee must see all quarterly goals (Q1-Q4) that were submitted in that year.

This API fetches:

Q1 submitted goals

Q2 submitted goals

Q3 submitted goals

Q4 submitted goals

Manager ratings/remarks (if given)

Final status

So employee can review their full year performance before giving self review.

✅ How it helps?

This API is used to show the Annual Review Screen, where employee sees yearly performance summary.

✅ Where requirement is written in PPT?

✅ Yes, clearly mentioned

📌 PPT Requirement (Copy / Meaning):
“Annual Performance Review will be based on all quarter goal submissions (Q1-Q4).”

and

“Employee should be able to view yearly goals summary for annual review.”

This line indicates the system must fetch all quarterly goals, so GET API is mandatory.

===============================================================================================================================

POST	:	 http://localhost:9010/api/annual-review/submit/EMP101

✅ Why we need this API?

Because after employee views their yearly goal summary, employee must submit their Self Assessment / Self Review.

This includes:

Self rating

Self comment

Achievements

Challenges

Overall performance remarks

So this API stores employee’s annual self review in database.

✅ How it helps?

This is the action that confirms:

✅ Employee has completed annual self review
✅ Annual review process can move to Manager / HR next step

✅ Where requirement is written in PPT?

✅ Yes

📌 PPT Requirement (Copy):
“Employee will fill self review and submit the annual review form.”

and

“Annual Performance Review submission by employee.”

This requirement directly demands a submission API, so POST is required.

===============================================================================================================================

PUT		:	http://localhost:9010/api/annual-review/manager-review/MGR001/EMP101

✅ Why we created this API?

Because after employee submits their Annual Self Review, the Manager (R1) must evaluate the employee’s yearly performance.

Manager should be able to fill:

Manager Rating

Manager Comment / Remarks

Overall annual assessment

So this API allows Manager to update the annual review record with their evaluation.

✅ How it helps?

This API helps in:

✅ Saving manager annual review feedback in database
✅ Updating annual review status:

SELF_SUBMITTED → MANAGER_REVIEWED

✅ Storing the review timestamp (managerReviewedAt)

This is required so that manager can complete annual review assessment before sending it to employee.

✅ Requirement mentioned in PPT?

✅ Yes

📌 PPT Requirement (Copy)

“Manager Assessment Section will be filled by the Manager.”
“Manager will review the annual performance review and provide rating and remarks.”

This requirement clearly states that Manager must enter assessment, so we need this API.

===================================================================================================================================

PUT 	:	http://localhost:9010/api/annual-review/submit-to-employee/MGR001/EMP101

✅ Why we used this API?

Because after the Manager (R1) completes the Annual Review rating + remarks, the process must move to the Employee for acceptance.

So this API is required to:

Confirm manager has completed annual assessment

Lock the manager’s rating/comments

Change Annual Review status from:

MANAGER_REVIEWED → SENT_TO_EMPLOYEE

Store timestamp (submittedToEmployeeAt)

Allow employee to see the reviewed annual assessment and then accept + final submit to HR

Without this API, manager rating will stay saved but the annual review will never move forward in workflow.

✅ Where it is written in PPT?

This is mentioned in the Annual Performance Review flow slides.

📌 PPT Requirement Line (Exact Meaning):

“SUBMIT TO EMPLOYEE”
“EMPLOYEE SCREEN”
“FINAL SUBMIT TO HR”

This is shown clearly in the Annual Review flow section where it displays:

R1 SCREEN → SUBMIT TO EMPLOYEE → EMPLOYEE SCREEN → FINAL SUBMIT TO HR

So the PPT explicitly requires a button/action called Submit to Employee, meaning backend must have an API for it.

==============================================================================================================================

PUT		:	http://localhost:9010/api/annual-review/final-submit/EMP101

✅ Why we used this API?

Because after the Manager (R1) finishes the Annual Review and clicks Submit to Employee, the employee must take final action.

So this API is required for:

✅ Employee Final Submission to HR

It confirms that:

Employee has reviewed manager rating/comments

Employee agrees with the annual assessment

Employee completes the Annual Review process

The review is now forwarded to HR

✅ Status Update

This API updates status from:

SENT_TO_EMPLOYEE → FINAL_SUBMITTED_TO_HR

This locks the annual review so no one can edit it again.

✅ Where it is written in PPT?

This is clearly mentioned in the Annual Review flow section of your PPT.

📌 In PPT, the flow is shown like:

R1 SCREEN → SUBMIT TO EMPLOYEE → EMPLOYEE SCREEN → FINAL SUBMIT TO HR

The PPT has a screen where employee has a button:

✅ “FINAL SUBMIT TO HR”

That exact button means backend must have an API for final submission.

✅ PPT Requirement Line (Exact Meaning)

In the Annual Review slide, it explicitly shows:

FINAL SUBMIT TO HR

And also the note says:

“Please Note : If YES gets selected then it can be submitted to HR”

Meaning employee must confirm acceptance and then submit to HR.
